# Hedgehog Server Demo

This demo is written using node.js, express.js and Postgres. To run, just clone the repo and run `docker-compose up`.

<b>**Note</b> If you're running the demo on windows or linux, you may need to change the `dbUrl` property in `default-config.json`. Docker for Mac needs special networking so the host is set to `docker.for.mac.localhost`. https://docs.docker.com/v17.09/docker-for-mac/networking/
